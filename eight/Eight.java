/*
Write a class called Student with
a) Instance variable roll_no, name, semester and branch
b) A default constructor Student () which must contain statements to set the values of instance
variables of each object of Student class from keyboard
c) A method called calculate () which does not have any input parameter and returns a double value.
This method must contain statements to take input for marks of 5 subjects (Physics, Chemistry,
Mathematics, English and Hindi) from the keyboard and statements to calculate the percentage of
marks obtained by each Student object using formula:
 Percentage marks=(Total marks/500)*100
The method must also contain a return statement to return the calculated percentage value
d) A method called showdata () which does not take any parameter and returns void. This method
must contain statement to display the values of roll no, name, semester, branch and percentage of 
Page 2 of 11
mark of each object of Student class
Write another class StudentRecord which contains the main () method. Inside the main() method write
statements to create 3 different object of Student class and display the values of their instance variable with
the calculated percentage of marks for each of them using Menu
